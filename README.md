    <h1>LGBTQIA+ Education & Awareness</h1>
    <p>If you were directed to this link through the poster and didn't understand the part that says "so many lives were taken based on assumptions," let me explain:</p>
    <p>Religion has been used many times by different people as a reason to commit cruelty not only against LGBTQIA+ people but also against those of other religions, because they believe their religion holds the truth.</p>
    <p>The point is that the foundation of any religion is faith, not facts. Of course, there are facts within what is believed, but religion itself, regardless of which one, cannot be considered a fact, because none of us knows which religion — if any — is correct. When it comes to religion, all we have is faith.</p>
    <p>So it's actually incoherent to judge someone for not following the principles of your religion. That's why, as said in the text, so many lives were taken based on assumptions.</p>
    <p><strong>(I want to make it very clear that I didn’t use the term “assumption” to belittle any religion or religion itself.)</strong></p><h2>Videos and Documentaries about Homosexuality and Homophobia</h2>
